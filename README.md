> **⭐ Star this repo if it helps you crack your interview!**

**104 solved problems across 15 topics**, organized by the patterns and data
structures that appear most often in Python interviews. Each solution includes
an approach and complexity analysis; priority questions are marked `_IMP`.

Browse the filterable [DSA Prep Atlas](https://dsa-prep-atlas.pages.dev/) or
follow the [Core 120 roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for the planned learning sequence.

## ✅ Core 120 Progress

**Core 120 progress:** 108 / 120 problems (90%)

The original 98-problem collection is complete. The repository is now adding
22 carefully selected questions to strengthen thin and missing interview patterns.

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Achal13jain/python-dsa-interview-prep.git
   cd python-dsa-interview-prep
   ```
2. **Navigate to a topic folder** and open any `.py` file.
3. **Read or run the solution** — some files include a `if __name__ == "__main__":` sample block, and the rest can be tested by calling the function/class directly.
4. **Focus on `_IMP` files** for quick interview prep — these are the priority revision picks in this repo.
5. **Read PATTERNS.md** to recognise which technique to apply when you see a problem signal.

### Run the quality checks

No third-party packages are required:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite checks solution behavior, Python 3.9 syntax, duplicate or missing
catalog entries, README counts, website mappings, and documentation redirects.
GitHub Actions runs the same checks on Python 3.9 and 3.13 for every push and
pull request.

## 💡 Problem Markers

- **`_IMP`** — Important priority picks for interview revision.
- **Regular files** — Core problems for building solid fundamentals.

## 📖 Recommended Learning Path

### Beginner
```
Basic and Maths → Array & Prefix Sum → Strings → Hashing
```

### Intermediate
```
Two Pointers & Sliding Window → Stack & Queue → Linked List
```

### Advanced
```
Trees → Binary Search → Greedy → Dynamic Programming
→ Graphs → Heap & Priority Queue → Backtracking → Trie
```

### Fast-track Interview Prep (2–3 weeks)
Focus on all **`_IMP`** files across every topic. They cover the patterns most likely to appear in a 45-minute interview round.
